# DPos-Blockchain-Node based on geth
A DPos blockchain node based on geth and inherited from heco-chain's geth implementation. The full blockchain infrastructure consists of physical nodes and system smart contracts. 
A node is used to validate transactions and produce new blocks. And the smart contracts are used to register block finality and create consensus among all the nodes. These system contracts are also responsible for rewarding nodes for their work, activating & deactivating a given node..etc. The consensus followed is determined by the logic dictated in the system contract. 

The idea behind this project is to encourage the use of blockchain infrastructure in the organizational structure of various institutions. Apart from that, this project is propelled by curiosity and a learning temper. The final goal of this project would be to create a plethora of tools with which one can build a full-fledged blockchain infrastructure with various sorts of applications.

Currently, the installation and setup process requires a lot of manual interaction. My first goal is to eliminate machine-doable manual tasks and streamline the whole experience.
